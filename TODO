Things to be done

 - testing this with kubernetes. Right now, I've only tried this
   with podman

 - testing this with several containers inside one pod

 - bugfixing

 - command line parsing. We want to make the port number
   configurable

 - extract the admin password from an environment variable, so
   that podman/kubernetes/etc can pass that secret

 - add a /fs service that lets you view random files inside the
   running container
