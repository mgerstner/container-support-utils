pam_container

This is a Linux PAM module that provides a session function to
enter an existing container.

Configuration options (via pam argv list):

    1. How to select a container. The default is "auto", which
       will pick any container that is visible to the process.
       This is mostly useful for sidecar containers, where you
       know there is only one other container.

       // Remark 4: it's a bit unclear here that the "container name" means
       // the "hostname" in the UTS namespace.
       Alternatively, there is "user" mode. In this mode,
       the module tries to attach to a container named
       user:$USERNAME, where $USERNAME is the name of the user
       being logged in.

    2. User policy. By default, pam_container will try to place
       each and every user into a container.

       You can tune this behavior by specifying user_apply=
       and user_ignore= options. For example, the following
       will try to place all users EXCEPT root in a container:

	user_ignore=root

       Alternatively, you may want to place ONLY gollum in
       a container, in which case you would use this:

	user_apply=gollum user_ignore=all


CAVEAT: Not all applications check the return value of
pam_open_session() or if they do, they may ignore it.  OpenSSH seems
to behave this way. In such a case, a failure of the pam_container
session management means that the user will be given a session in
the host context.



TODO:
 Option to export additional directories to the session, just like
 ns-exec supports.
